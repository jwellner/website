As I explained in this [blog post](http://www.wllnr.nl/blog/2016/02/moved-to-static-website/) I moved my personal website to a static generated site hosted on Google cloud storage.

I was planning on writing a blog post on the technical details. But then I was thinking why not put the whole site in a public github repository?
