In this blog you will read about my other passion: riding my roadbike.

This year I will spend a little bit less working to persue another big goal. Last year I joined [my clubs](https://www.cs030.nl) racing team and did some amateur classics and criteriums. I found i'm better in the hills, so when my club started a new [Grand Fondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Fondo) team, I didn't hesitate and joined!

My goal (and that of rest of our team) is to qualify for the **UCI Gran Fondo World Championships** in Varese, Italy. You can do this finising top 20% in one of the Gran Fondo's in the [UCI Gran Fondo World Series](http://www.ucigranfondoworldseries.com/).

Because I really want to get the maximum out of myself this year (yes I started training like a pro in november) I put the fulltime external jobs on hold. When training 12+ hours a week you need your rest and be able to plan your training over the day. I am still be available for **remote** work where I am more flexible to plan my work around training.

Bellow you will find the races I will be doing:
