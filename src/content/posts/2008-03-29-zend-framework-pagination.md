I'm currently using [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com) on a small project. On this project i have to make a lot of lists views. For that reason i was in need for some sort of Zend Pagination plugin/library. Searching the Internet I found a few like the ones on [DigitalFashion](http://fashion.hosmoz.net/post/2007/09/23/Zend-Framework-Pagination-third-strike) and [Fantasy pig](http://f-pig.blogspot.com/2007/10/try-zend-framework-vol6-simple-pager.html) but it wasn't really wat i was looking for. [Kohana](http://doc.kohanaphp.com/libraries/pagination#pagination_library) PHP Framework has got a nice Pagination solution so I decided to build one like that for the Zend Framework.

Templates include digg, classic, extended en punbb -style pagination!

I'm not (yet) a Zend Framework specialist so suggestions for improvement are welcome!
