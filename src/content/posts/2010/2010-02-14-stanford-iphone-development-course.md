![images](http://www.wllnr.nl/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/images.jpeg)Last year Stanford University started their iPhone application programming course for the first time. I wasn't able to follow the class that time but luckily this year they're back with the [CS193P Winter 2010 class](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/). This class will cover the iPhone OS 3.1 and is freely available on iTunes U.
