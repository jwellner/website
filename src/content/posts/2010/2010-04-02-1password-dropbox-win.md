I was already using [1Password](http://www.1password.com) in combination with [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTEyNDQxOQ) to sync my password database on multiple macs. But there are even more benefits storing your 1Password database on dropbox: You will get a webinterface with it! Just log in on [dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTEyNDQxOQ) account and browse to your [1Password](http://www.1password.com) database file. You will notice it is a directory now, click on the 1password.html file and there you go.
